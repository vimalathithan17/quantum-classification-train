# QML Models Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to `qml_models.py` based on code review feedback to make the quantum machine learning models safer, faster, and easier to debug/maintain.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. QNode Caching (Performance Improvement)
**Issue**: QNodes were being recreated on every call to `_get_circuit()`, which is expensive.

**Solution**: Cache the QNode once during `__init__` and reuse it.

**Implementation**:
- Added `self._qcircuit = self._get_circuit()` in `__init__` for all 4 model classes
- Updated `_batched_qcircuit` to use `getattr(self, "_qcircuit", None) or self._get_circuit()`
- Removed redundant `qcircuit = self._get_circuit()` calls from fit() methods (where applicable)

**Impact**: Reduces overhead from repeated QNode construction and avoids repeated re-registration of operations.

### 2. Empty Batch Handling (Robustness)
**Issue**: Empty batches would cause `vstack([])` to raise an exception.

**Solution**: Explicitly check for empty batches and return appropriately shaped empty arrays.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Empty batch
if X_arr.shape[0] == 0:
    return np.empty((0, self.n_meas), dtype=np.float64)  # n_meas = number of measurement outcomes
```

**Impact**: Prevents crashes when processing empty batches, making the code more robust.

### 3. Debug Logging (Debugging)
**Issue**: When batched calls failed, the exception was silently swallowed, making debugging difficult.

**Solution**: Add debug-level logging when batched calls fail and when using fallback mode.

**Implementation**:
```python
log.debug("qcircuit batched fast-path used")
log.debug(f"qcircuit batched call failed, falling back to parallel eval: {type(e).__name__}")
log.debug(f"Using joblib Parallel fallback with n_jobs={n_jobs}")
```

Note: In the actual implementation, we log the full exception for debugging purposes since debug logs are typically only enabled during development.

**Impact**: Failures are now visible when debugging with log level set to DEBUG.

### 4. Input Validation (Type Safety)
**Issue**: Input arrays could have unexpected shapes, causing per-iteration type surprises.

**Solution**: Cast inputs to at least 2D at the start of fit() method.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Ensure X is at least 2D to avoid per-iteration type surprises
X = np.atleast_2d(np.asarray(X, dtype=np.float64))

# Ensure validation data is also at least 2D
if X_val is not None:
    X_val = np.atleast_2d(np.asarray(X_val, dtype=np.float64))
```

**Impact**: Reduces type-related bugs and makes code more predictable.

### 5. Thread-Safety Documentation
**Issue**: Not all devices are thread-safe, but documentation didn't mention this.

**Solution**: Add docstring notes about threading backend and thread-safety.

**Implementation**:
```python
"""Multiclass VQC for pre-processed, dimensionally-reduced data with classical readout.

Note: Threading backend is used for fallback parallelism. If device is not thread-safe,
set n_jobs=1 to force sequential execution.
"""
```

**Impact**: Users are now aware of potential thread-safety issues and how to work around them.

### 6. Improved _batched_qcircuit Method
**Complete updated signature and docstring**:
```python
def _batched_qcircuit(self, X, weights, n_jobs=None):
    """Batched wrapper: try true batched qnode first, otherwise parallel per-sample.
    
    Args:
        X: Input data array, shape (N, n_features) or (n_features,)
        weights: Quantum circuit weights
        n_jobs: Number of parallel jobs (None uses self.n_jobs)

    Returns:
        np.ndarray shape (N, n_meas)
    """
```

**Features**:
- Uses cached QNode
- Handles empty batches
- Logs debug information
- Falls back to parallel execution when batched call fails

## Classes Updated

All 4 model classes received these improvements:
1. `MulticlassQuantumClassifierDR`
2. `MulticlassQuantumClassifierDataReuploadingDR`
3. `ConditionalMulticlassQuantumClassifierFS`
4. `ConditionalMulticlassQuantumClassifierDataReuploadingFS`

## Testing

### New Tests Created (`tests/test_qnode_caching.py`)
1. `test_qnode_cached_on_init` - Verifies QNode is cached during initialization
2. `test_qnode_reused_not_recreated` - Verifies cached QNode is reused, not recreated
3. `test_empty_batch_handling_all_classes` - Tests empty batch handling for all classes
4. `test_debug_logging_on_fallback` - Tests debug logging when batched call fails
5. `test_atleast_2d_input_validation` - Tests input validation with atleast_2d
6. `test_all_classes_have_cached_qnode` - Verifies all classes cache the QNode
7. `test_batched_qcircuit_uses_getattr` - Tests getattr fallback mechanism

### Test Results
- New tests: **7/7 passing** ✓
- Existing batched training tests: **6/6 passing** ✓
- Integration tests: **3/3 passing** ✓
- Softmax/predict tests: **9/9 passing** ✓

**Total: 25/25 tests passing**

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements
1. **QNode caching**: Eliminates repeated QNode construction overhead
2. **Batched fast-path**: When supported, processes entire batch at once
3. **Threaded fallback**: When batched call fails, uses threading to avoid pickling overhead

### Memory & Concurrency
- Default `n_jobs=-1` uses all CPU cores
- Users can adjust with `n_jobs=N` or set to 1 for sequential execution
- Threading backend avoids pickling QNode state

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are **fully backward compatible**:
- Public API unchanged
- Default behavior preserved
- New features add safety without breaking existing code

## Future Considerations

1. **Chunked fallback**: For very large batches, consider chunked evaluation to reduce job scheduling overhead
2. **Device-specific backends**: Allow switching between threading, sequential, or chunked backends based on device capabilities
3. **Performance metrics**: Add optional timing metrics to track fast-path vs fallback usage
